        Daily schedule recommender wants to assist the students who tends to overwork or struggles with which task shall be done first. With the computed priority and estimated time, the program can sort and separate the tasks suited for a day. With these limited tasks per day, the program hopes that the users will lessen their academic burnout. Other people aside from students may also find this useful when creating their daily schedule.
      </p>

      <p class="about-info">
        The recommended active hours which is 8.6 per day was based on the research of Korsakas on 2023 while the computation for priority was from the article made by Tom Gidden titled A Rational Model of Task Priority.

        How to use the Daily Task Organizer?
      </p>

      <p class="about-info">
        Before clicking the add task button, the user shall have an input in each blank field. The input in title and descriptions are optional since it can be edited later, however the input for estimated time is required in order to set a recommended schedule per day. Carefully thinking about the priority input is also recommended as this will determine which among the inputted task shall be included first and which shall be considered last. There can be times that low priority tasks are included in the first day, this happens as the algorithm is maximizing the user's daily active hours.
      </p>

      <p class="about-info">
        The program has a feature of tracking the time spent on each task by starting the countdown timer and the user may be able to pause it when they suddenly have different things to do aside from the current task. The user can also edit their schedule's title and description once it is generated however, they can't edit the estimated time as their active hours per day shall be strictly limited. In cases they want to change the estimated time of the ask, they shall delete it and adjust the inputted time of the task before adding it to the list of schedules.
